      This Agreement of Processing of Personal Data ("the Agreement") is a
      legally binding document that outlines the terms and conditions under
      which personal data is processed by a data processor on behalf of a data
      controller. This Agreement is designed to ensure compliance with relevant
      data protection laws and regulations, including but not limited to the
      General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable national
      and international data protection laws. Parties Involved: a. Data
      Controller: [Name and contact details of the data controller] b. Data
      Processor: [Name and contact details of the data processor] Purpose of
      Processing: The data controller engages the data processor to perform
      certain processing activities on personal data. The purpose of processing,
      including the nature and scope of the processing, should be clearly
      defined in this section. Obligations of the Data Controller: The data
      controller shall ensure that the personal data provided to the data
      processor is lawful and that the data subjects have been appropriately
      informed about the processing activities. The data controller shall also
      ensure that it has obtained any necessary consents or legal basis for
      processing the personal data. Obligations of the Data Processor: The data
      processor shall process personal data only on the documented instructions
      of the data controller, unless required by law to do otherwise. The data
      processor shall implement appropriate technical and organizational
      measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal data.
      Data Subject Rights: Both the data controller and data processor shall
      cooperate in fulfilling data subjects' rights, such as access,
      rectification, erasure, and objection. The data processor shall assist the
      data controller in responding to data subject requests, as required by
      applicable data protection laws. Subprocessing: If the data processor
      engages sub-processors to assist in the processing of personal data, the
      data processor shall ensure that such sub-processors provide sufficient
      guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures
      to protect the personal data. Data Security: The data processor shall take
      appropriate measures to ensure the security of personal data, including
      protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss,
      destruction, or damage. This may include encryption, pseudonymization,
      access controls, and regular security assessments. Data Breach
      Notification: The data processor shall promptly notify the data controller
      in the event of a personal data breach. The data processor shall cooperate
      with the data controller in investigating and mitigating the effects of
      the breach and take necessary actions to prevent future breaches. Data
      Transfer: If personal data is transferred to a country or international
      organization outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or any other
      territory that is not deemed to provide an adequate level of data
      protection, appropriate safeguards shall be implemented, such as Standard
      Contractual Clauses or other lawful mechanisms. Term and Termination: This
      Agreement shall remain in effect until the completion of the processing
      activities or as otherwise specified. Termination of the Agreement should
      outline the obligations regarding data deletion or return. Governing Law
      and Jurisdiction: The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
      accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction specified. Any disputes
      arising from or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the
      exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in the specified jurisdiction.
      Amendments and Modifications: Any amendments or modifications to this
      Agreement shall be made in writing and agreed upon by both parties. By
      signing this Agreement, the data controller and data processor acknowledge
      their respective roles and responsibilities in the processing of personal
      data and agree to abide by the terms and conditions outlined herein.
